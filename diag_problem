Update the diagnostic settings for the AI Foundry (ai-foundry-eastus2) resource so that all log categories except Audit Logs are sent to the Log Analytics Workspace: log-app-common-eus2-01.

Audit Logs should continue being streamed to the existing Event Hub, preserving the current configuration.

This change is required to centralize operational logs for observability while maintaining compliance‑driven separation of audit data.
